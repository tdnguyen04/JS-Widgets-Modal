JS-Widgets is series of small projects that work on implementing popular design elements in real projects that confuse me when I encounter the first time

# Modal (window) definition

Modal (or lightbox) is a web page element that displays in front of the main content while deactivating them until the modal is closed

# Why I care

I was working on [Planner App](https://github.com/tdnguyen04/Planner-App) that I realize I need a pop-up modal to ask the user verify before they delete all tasks, in case they click the button by accident. This is also the first time I learn about the definition of modal window and its extensive use cases (mentioned next).

# Popular use cases

- Webpage cookies permission
- A window pops up when writing a status on Facebook
- Email subscription

# Features

## Open modal:

- Click on button "Open modal"

## Close modal

- Click close button
- Press ESC key
- Click outside of modal box

# Deploy

I use Vercel to deploy this simple web app

# Credit

This project is inspired by [John Smilga](https://github.com/john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects/tree/master/06-modal). My starter code is based on his in the repo.
